## Kaggle House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices using advanced regression models. The approach leverages ensemble learning and hyperparameter optimization to enhance the performance of the models.

Overview
- The solution integrates six machine learning models for robust price prediction:
1. Lasso Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
4. LightGBM (LGBM)
5. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
6. XGBoost

Project Structure
- Data/: Contains the training and testing datasets:
- train.csv: Training dataset.
- test.csv: Testing dataset.
- House-Price-Prediction-Solution.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the complete implementation of the solution.
- .gitignore: Specifies files and folders to exclude from version control.
- README.md: Project documentation.
- requirments.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

Getting Started
- Prerequisites
: Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system. Use the requirements.txt file to set up the required libraries.

Installation

1. cd Kaggle-House-Price-Prediction-main
2. pip install -r requirments.txt


Running the Solution
1. python House-Price-Prediction-Solution.ipynb



Methodology
- The project implements the following:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
2. Model Training: Fits six regression models with hyperparameter tuning.
3. Ensemble Learning: Combines the predictions of all models for improved accuracy.
4. Evaluation: Measures performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.


Results
- The ensemble model outperforms individual models, showcasing the strength of combining predictions.
